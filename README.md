# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Website is responsive, theme featured with the use of redux-toolkit for state management.

Let me take you to a detailed tour of the current website.

1. As the website starts it opens to home page(snap is provided in Image folder.). Further if we click "Click to Login" it takes us to Login page.
2. Here further clicking "Login" it fetches the OAuth link where authorization is done once, here the route is given as "/login".
3. Further on logging in it takes to the trending repository page with route "/repo". Here as we login access token is generated in the backend is fetched to frontend to show github avatar and name.
4. The trending repositories data fetched can be filtered acoording to language and date range. Only repository name and language is shown in trending repo page. Individual information is shown in next page.
5. If any repository is clicked it navigates to "/repo/<repo-name>" page. It contains details of
   a. repository name
   b. language
   c. immediate stars
   d. date range
   e. forks
   f. stars
6. Finally, on clicking logout it takes back to home page "/"

Images are placed in image folder under frontend folder. Image series is given below to refer:
-> Home page
-> Login page
-> Authorization page
-> Trending repo page
-> Individual repo page
